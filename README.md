Example PHP project
===================

The purpose of this repository is to show how to use Travis CI to do
continuous integration with a PHP project.

Here is a sample status icon showing the state of the master branch.

[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/madrizcarlose/php-example.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/travis-ci-examples/php)


In order to run this project just fork it on github.com and then [enable](http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/getting-started/)
your fork on your [travis-ci profile](http://travis-ci.org/profile). Every push will then trigger a new build on Travis CI.

(Don't forget to update the badge url in the README to point to your own travis project.)
